        <h1>Modifications available</h1>
            <p>There are hundreds of modifications available for the Cessna 150. Some of the most frequently installed include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vortex generators and STOL kits that reduce the stall speed of the plane.</li>
                <li>Flap gap seals to reduce drag and increase rate of climb.</li>
                <li>Different wing tips, some of which claim various cruise speed increases and stall speed reductions.</li>
                <li>Auto fuel STCs, which permit the use of automobile fuel instead of the more expensive aviation fuel.</li>
                <li>Larger engines, up to 180 horsepower (130 kW).</li>
                <li>Taildragger landing gear.</li>
                <li>Auxiliary fuel tanks for larger capacity.</li>
                <li>Door catches to replace the factory ones that often fail in service.</li>
                <li>Belly fuel drain valves to drain fuel from the lowest point in the fuel system.</li>
            </ul>
        <h1>Flight characteristics</h1>
            <p>The Cessna 150 is simple, robust, and easy to fly. For these reasons it has become one of the world's most popular basic trainers.</p>

            <p>Cockpit visibility is generally good other than directly above the aircraft, where the view is blocked by the wing. This obstruction is of particular concern when, as is the case with most high-wing aircraft, the inside-turn wing blocks vision in the direction of a turn. As a partial remedy to this some 150s, including all Aerobats, feature a pair of overhead skylights.</p>

            <p>Due to its light weight and light wing loading (10 lb/sq ft), the aircraft is sensitive to turbulence.</p>

            <p>Power-on and power-off stalls are easily controlled. Normal spin recovery techniques are highly effective.</p>
          
          <h1>Noteworthy flights</h1>
            <p>On August 8, 1964, a pair of commercial pilots flew a Cessna 150 into the Meteor Crater in Arizona. On crossing the rim, they could not maintain level flight. The pilot attempted to build up speed by circling in the crater to climb over the rim. During the attempted climbout, the aircraft stalled, crashed, and caught fire. It is commonly reported that the plane ran out of fuel, but this is incorrect. Both occupants were severely injured but survived their ordeal.[13] A small portion of the wreckage not removed from the crash site remains visible to this day.</p>

            <p>In the summer of 1980 a Cessna 150F was flown from London, England to Darwin, Australia in 32 stages by Janette Schönburg, a 27-year-old female pilot. Schönburg made the flight to commemorate the 50th anniversary of pioneering female aviator Amy Johnson's 1930 flight between the two cities. This aircraft, UK registration G-AWAW, was used for several years as a static display at the London Science Museum. In May 2010 it was donated to the Cessna 150-152 Club, and shipped to Florida where it is being restored by club members.</p>

            <p>On September 12, 1994, Frank Eugene Corder intentionally crashed a Cessna 150L onto the South Lawn of the White House against the south wall of the Executive Mansion, in an apparent suicide. Corder was killed, but no one else was injured and damage to property on the ground was minimal.</p>

            <p>In 1996 a Cessna 150 was flown from the United States to South Africa in several stages, crossing the Atlantic along the way. An extra 60 gallon fuel tank was installed (beyond the standard 22.5 gallons) and the plane took off 500 lb (230 kg) over gross weight.</p>
