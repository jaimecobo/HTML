<h4>150</h4>

<p>The first model year of the Cessna 150 carried no suffix letter. It was available as the "150" or the upgraded "Commuter". The engine was a 100 horsepower (75&#160;kW) Continental O-200, the gross weight was 1,500&#160;lb (680&#160;kg) and flaps were actuated manually with a lever between the seats. Production commenced late in 1958 as the 1959 model year.</p>
<p>The cost was 6,995 for the Standard Model 150, $7,940 for the Trainer and $8,545 for the Commuter.</p>
<p>The 1960 model introduced a 35-ampere generator on the Commuter. The "patroller" was also introduced in 1960. This was a standard 150 with  windows on the lower doors, 35 long-range fuel tanks and a message chute for dropping packages to the ground.</p>
<p>Production was 122 in 1958, 648 in 1959 and 354 in 1960.</p>
<h4>150A</h4>
<p>The 1961 model incorporated enough changes to justify a suffix letter and thus was designated the “150A”.</p>
<p>The "A" had its main landing gear moved aft by two inches to eliminate the problem of the aircraft ending up on its tail while loading people and baggage and also to improve nosewheel steering authority.</p>
<p>The "A" also had 15% larger rear side windows and new adjustable seats. 344 were constructed.</p>
<h4>150B</h4>
<p>The 150B was the 1962 model. It had a new propeller that increased cruise speed by 2 knots (3.7&#160;km/h) and the option of a two-passenger child seat for the baggage compartment. 331 "B" models were built. The Commuter version cost US$8,995.</p>
<h4>150C</h4>
<p>The 1963 model was the "C", which introduced the option of larger 6.00×6 inch tires to replace the standard 5.00×5 tires and fuel quick drains. 472 were completed.</p>
<h4>150D</h4>
<p>The 1964 "D" model brought the first dramatic change to the 150 – the introduction of a rear window under the marketing name. The rear window changed the look of the 150 and cost 3&#160;mph (4.8&#160;km/h) in cruise speed. It also resulted in a larger baggage compartment and a greater structural weight allowance for baggage from 80 to 120&#160;lb (54&#160;kg). The unswept tailfin from previous years was retained for another two years. Elevator and rudder mass balances were increased to reduce flutter potential caused by the less aerodynamic rear fuselage. The gross weight of the aircraft was also increased in 1964 to 1,600&#160;lb (730&#160;kg), where it would stay until the advent of the. 804 150Ds were built.</p>
<p>Many people find the new cabin more "airy" and pleasant, due to the increased light.</p>
<h4>150E</h4>
<p>The 1965 Cessna 150E saw only the addition of new seats, although the standard empty weight went up 40&#160;lb (18&#160;kg) that year to 1,010&#160;lb (460&#160;kg). The "E" model saw production increase to 1637 aircraft.</p>
<h4>150F</h4>
<p>The 1966 model saw great changes to the 150 design. The tailfin was swept back 35 degrees to match the styling of the and other models. The cabin doors were made 23% wider, new brakes were brought in and the 6.00×6 tires were made standard. The previously manual flaps were now electrically actuated through a panel-mounted flap switch. The old electric stall warning system was replaced with a pneumatic-type. The baggage compartment was enlarged by 50%. A total of 3087 of the newly styled "F" models were produced.</p> <p>1966 was also the first production of French Reims-built F-150s, with 67 built as the F150F.</p><a href="Variants2.html" class="button-more">Read more</a>
