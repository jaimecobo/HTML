        <p>Development of the Model 150 began in the mid-1950s with the decision by  Aircraft to produce a successor to the popular which finished production in 1951. The main changes in the 150 design were the use of tricycle landing gear, which is easier to learn to use than the tailwheel landing gear of the Cessna 140, and replacing the rounded wingtips and horizontal and vertical stabilizers with more modern, squared-off profiles. In addition, the narrow, hinged wing flaps of the 140 were replaced by larger, far more effective flaps.</p>
          <p>The Cessna 150 prototype first flew on September 12, 1957, with production commencing in September 1958 at Cessna's Wichita, Kansas plant. 216 aircraft were also produced by Reims Aviation under license in. These French manufactured 150s were designated Reims F-150, the "F" indicating they were built in France.</p>
          <p>American-made 150s were all produced with the Continental O-200-A 100&#160;hp (75&#160;kW) engine, but the Reims-built aircraft are powered by a -built Continental O-200-As, with some Continental O-240-A powered versions.</p>
          <p>All Cessna 150s have very effective flaps that extend 40 degrees.</p>
          <p>The best-performing airplanes in the 150 and 152 fleet are the 1962 Cessna 150B and the 1963 Cessna 150C. Thanks to their light 1,500&#160;lb (680&#160;kg) gross weight and more aerodynamic rear fuselage, they climb the fastest, have the highest ceilings, and require the shortest runways. They have a 109-knot (202&#160;km/h) cruise speed, faster than any other model year of either the 150 or 152.</p>
          <p>All models from 1966 onwards have larger doors and increased baggage space. With the 1967 Model 150G the doors were bowed outwards 1.5 inches (38&#160;mm) on each side to provide more cabin elbow room.</p>
          <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket"></span></span></h2>
          <p>A total of 22,138 Cessna 150s were built in the United States, including 21,404 Commuters and 734 Aerobats. Reims Aviation completed 1,764 F-150s, of which 1,428 were Commuters and 336 were Aerobats. A Reims affiliate in Argentina also assembled 47 F-150s, including 38 Commuters and 9 Aerobats.</p>
          <p>Of all the Cessna 150-152 models, the 1966 model year was the most plentiful with 3,067 1966 Cessna 150s produced. This was the first year the aircraft featured a swept tail fin, increased baggage area and electrically operated flaps.</p>

          <p>The 150 was succeeded in the summer of 1977 by the closely related Cessna 152. The 152 is more economical to operate due to the increased TBO (time between overhaul) of the Lycoming O-235 engine. The 152 had its flap travel limited to 30 degrees from the 150's 40 degree deflection for better climb with full flaps and the maximum certified gross weight was increased from 1,600&#160;lb (726&#160;kg) on the 150 to 1670&#160;lb (757&#160;kg) on the 152. Production of the 152 ended in 1985 when manufacturing of all Cessna piston singles was suspended.</p>
